# Sumobot_Robot_Controller
### Overview
This project was made with the purpose of creating a robot that will compete in a tournament to push the enemy robot out of the arena. The robot uses a QTI sensor to detect whether it is in or out of bounds of the arena and a sonar to detect the respective oponent's location.
### Strategy
The main strategy of this robot is to use the 3 sonar's attached to it to help find the opposing robot. The idea behind the 3 sonars is to take advantage of its wider field of vision. This will help it quickly find the opponent and start lunging towards it, before the opponent finds it. It has a defensive strategy that moves away from the bound if it detects it and an offensive strategy that will push the opponent until it is out of bounds.
